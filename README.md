# banknoteBrazil: Brazilian paper money
This repository contains a classification of Brazilian paper money.

## Training image classification Brazilian paper money model

You can download the freely available datasets with the provided script (it may take a while):

```bash
$ sh app/src/data/download_validation.sh  
```

### Requirements
Python 3.8 or later with all [requirements.txt](https://github.com/joaofracasso/banknoteBrazil/blob/master/app/requirements.txt) dependencies installed. To install run:

```bash
$ python -m pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```

### Environments

BanknoteBrazil may be run in any of the following up-to-date verified environments ([Python](https://www.python.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) preinstalled):

- **Codespace** See [Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
- **VS Code** See [Vs Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)

### Train the network

You can train the network with the `train.py` script. For more usage information see [this](train.py). To train with the default parameters:

```bash
$ python app/src/modeling/train_model.py
```

### Evaluating the model

Also, you can evaluate the model against the validation set

```bash
$ python app/src/modeling/evaluate_model.py
```

## Predicting the outputs

To predict the outputs of a trained model using some dataset:

```bash
$  python app/src/modeling/predict_model.py --file data/test/2reaisVerso/compressed_20_9551306.jpeg
```

## Deploy on lambda container

Build the app Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build --pull --rm -f "app/Dockerfile" -t banknotebrazil:latest "app" 
```

Run the app of bankNote:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 banknotebrazil:latest
```

Send send an (base64) image over a POST request:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "body": "image/jpeg;base64"  
}' 
```
